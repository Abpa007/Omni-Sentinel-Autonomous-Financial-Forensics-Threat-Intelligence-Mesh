
# 🛡️ Omni-Sentinel | Autonomous Financial Forensics Mesh

An enterprise-grade financial forensics engine leveraging **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, **Neo4j graph persistence**, and **Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence** to intercept structural anomalies, money laundering patterns, and high-risk financial transactions in real time.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 📊 **Executive Forensics Dashboard:** Real-time risk monitoring, KPI telemetry, interactive sub-graph visualizations, and transaction audit trails built with Streamlit.
* 🕸️ **Persistent Graph Topology:** Native integration with Neo4j to store transactional graph relationships `(Account)-[:TRANSFER]->(Account)`.
* ⚡ **GNN Inference Engine:** GraphSAGE-driven anomaly detection delivering sub-5ms transaction scoring.
* 🤖 **Multi-Agent Forensics Swarm:** Automated multi-agent workflow for ingestion, feature extraction, graph persistence, and alert escalation.
* 🐳 **Docker Orchestrated Infrastructure:** Containerized service stack for seamless deployment and orchestration.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop running with WSL2 backend enabled.
* Python 3.10+ installed.

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
```

### 3. Spin Up Neo4j Graph Service

```bash
docker compose up -d neo4j
```

### 4. Verify Database Connectivity & Logging
Run a quick sanity check to test database persistence:

```bash
python -c "from engine.neo4j_connector import Neo4jConnector; db = Neo4jConnector(); print('Logged:', db.log_transaction(tx_id=101, source_node=1001, target_node=2002, amount=1500.50, risk_score=0.85))"
```
*Expected Output:* `Logged: True`

### 5. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

```bash
python -m streamlit run dashboard.py
```
Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501` to view the live dashboard.
